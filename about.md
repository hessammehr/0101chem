## What is <span class="digital">0101</span>chem?
<span class="digital">0101</span>chem is the web presence for the outreach project *Digital Chemistry for Digital Natives*. The project is aimed at familiarizing high school students in Glasgow .... The ideal outcome is for students to leave with enough knowledge and confidence to envision their own integration of science and digital information.

## Why is it called <span class="digital">0101</span>chem?
<span class="digital">0101</span>chem is a nod to how information has been embedded in chemistry since the beginning and how it is increasingly influencing chemistry's evolution.

We wanted to engage young minds in a discussion around science, specifically chemistry, and the information inherent in facets of it that we don't normally associate with computers. Computing has become a mainstay of everyday life, both in familiar forms like websites and mobile phone apps as well as less familiar ones like robotics, embedded devices, and artificial intelligence. <span class="digital">0101</span>chem also explores how these myriad forms can empower chemists and broaden the types of questions that chemistry can aim to answer.
