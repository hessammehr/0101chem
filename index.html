<p>Scientific experiments look more serious and less fun than games. In reality, experiments and games both try to <em>simulate</em> <dfn def="Phenomena: Things that happen in the world around us.">phenomena</dfn>, so they are based on the same principles.</p>

<p>There is a reason cooking takes years to master. A lot goes into making a delicious dish. Not only do you need to know the right ingredients in the right amounts, it also matter in what order you combine them. And when you teach a recipe to someone else, all these details needs to be communicated as well. Chemicals and chemical reactions can be even more picky. Some compounds are quickly oxidized when exposed to the atmosphere, for example, and some reactions only work within a precise temperature range. That’s why chemical procedures are often more detailed than cooking recipes. Thankfully, computers are very good at following instructions exactly; they do exactly what they are told, no more and no less.</p>
<p>We used programming languages to write code that precisely communicates our intentions to the computer. It turns out that we can do the same thing for chemistry: write chemical programs that a robot (or a human who doesn’t know anything about chemistry) can execute.</p>
