<p>Scientific experiments look more serious and less fun than games. In reality, experiments and games both try to <em>simulate</em> <dfn def="Phenomena: Things that happen in the world around us.">phenomena</dfn>, so they are based on the same principles.</p>

<h2 id="instructions-recipes-code">Instructions, recipes, code</h2>
<p>There is a reason cooking takes years to master. A lot goes into making a delicious dish. Not only do you need to add the right ingredients and the right amount of each, the order in which you combine them also matters. When you teach a recipe to someone else, all these details needs to be communicated as well.</p>
<p>Chemicals and chemical reactions can be even more picky. Some compounds are quickly oxidized when exposed to oxygen in the air, for example, and some reactions only work within a precise temperature range. That’s why chemical procedures are often more detailed than cooking recipes. Thankfully, computers are very good at following instructions exactly; they do exactly what they are told, no more and no less.</p>

<p>Just like we can use programming languages to write code that precisely communicates our intentions to the computer, we can do the same thing for chemistry: write chemical programs that a robot (or a human who doesn’t know much about chemistry) can execute.</p>
<h2 id="search-surprise-discovery">Search, surprise, discovery</h2>
<p>Many everyday situations require us to find a happy medium — turning the dials until everything is just right. Here is an example. Try seasoning a dish to perfection by finding the right amount of salt and pepper.</p>

<p>A lot of science and engineering is also about searching for the best <dfn def="Parameters, variables (sometimes also called inputs): Things that we can choose, adjust or specify that will determine the outcome of an experiment or process.">parameters</dfn> in a given a problem.</p>
